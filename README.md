Basic example of using Bootswatch theme in a Shiny for Python application
=========================================================================

This is a very basic example of a Shiny for Python application using a theme from Bootswatch.

It uses the Morph theme, from https://bootswatch.com/morph/. The CSS file can be downloaded from that page, or from other theme pages at https://bootswatch.com/.

The JS file is a standard Bootstrap JS file, and is shared across all the themes. It can be found be viewing the source of the Bootswatch page, and looking for bootstrap.bundle.min.js.
